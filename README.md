# Introduction
- This is the first web application I developed. It was crude, it was awful. The JavaScript is sort of a confusing mixture of ES6 and arcade JavaScript. None of those reusable components or other good stuff here. The CSS code was all over the place, with no media queries or any cross-browser support like `-webkit-`. But at that time, in front of hundreds of people, it worked. Except I suffered from serious intercostal neuralgia for a few days. 
- I deleted all of the images and sensible data
- I kept all of my *shitty* design process in `./structure.pdf`
